### Copying source code to Google spreadsheets

Each GLVN spreadsheet has a release date in GLVN menu. If the release date is older than the one in the source code, you should copy the source code to the spreadsheet. For students-master and students-extra, just copy the respectively source code into the spreadsheet. For class spreadsheets (GL1A, VN1A..), you need to copy source code from class-library.gs into class-library spreadsheet. The code in class-library spreadsheet is used in all class spreadsheets. In some cases, the library does not work. In this case, you will need to copy code from class-library.gs to all class spreadsheets.
